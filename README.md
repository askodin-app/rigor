# The Rigor Protocol: How We Build Judgment at askOdin
A company dedicated to building "Judgment Infrastructure" must itself be an engine of uncompromised rigor. Our product is a reflection of our process.
This document is a living blueprint of the core principles that guide our work, our decisions, and our culture. It is our commitment to intellectual honesty, made public.

##1. Thesis-Driven Action.
Every feature we build, every line of code we write, and every partnership we consider must be directly defensible against our core thesis: "Judgment is the last unscalable asset." Work that does not directly serve the mission of scaling judgment is a distraction. We prioritize ruthless focus over scattered effort.

## 2. Intellectual Honesty > Being Right.
Our internal conversations are sparring matches, not performances. We expect arguments to be strong, but personal attachments to ideas to be weak. The goal is to arrive at the correct decision, not to defend a previously held position. We celebrate colleagues who challenge our assumptions, especially when they challenge the founder's. Data and logic are our only arbiters of truth.
## 3. Decisions are Documented and Defensible.
As a pre-seed company, our most valuable asset is our decision-making process itself. Every critical decision—product, technical, or strategic—is documented in a short, structured brief outlining the context, the options considered, and the rationale for the final choice. This creates a "scar tissue" library that allows us to learn from both our wins and our failures with perfect fidelity. It is how we build our own institutional judgment.

## 4. Asynchronous by Default.
Deep work requires uninterrupted time. Our default mode of collaboration is asynchronous, using detailed, written documents and targeted communication. Meetings are the exception, not the rule. They are a tool of last resort, reserved for high-stakes debate and final decision-making, never for simple information transfer. We respect the clock and the calendar as the finite resources they are.

## This is Our Standard.
This protocol is how we hold ourselves accountable to the mission. It is our defense against the hype and distraction of the market.
If this commitment to rigor, intellectual honesty, and thesis-driven work resonates with you, you are the type of builder we are looking for.
